# Mock Restaurant Website: Grandbuffet

## Description

This is a mock restaurant website based on many modern websites that exist on the internet today.
I created the design of the website's logo in Adobe Illustrator and designed the website itself in Adobe XD.
It runs as a single page application without any JavaScript frameworks such as React.js or Vue.js.
This website also functions as a native web application due to Node.js and Express handling all of the client side routing.
All of the views that are contained in the frontend folder displays content using class based functions.
Content within those files are distributed throughout VS code using JavaScript modules.

## Conclusion

It was a challenge to learn how to re-use Adobe XD but, I was able to create a draft that I was satisfied with to use for the base of this project.
I was also able to learn how to make my website dynamic without the use of a JavaScript framework.
Before this, I had not used JavaScript modules in my website projects.
Now, I'm thinking of how can I apply what I've learned about JavaScript modules to other projects in the future.
Overall, this was a great experience and I'd love to make something similar in the future.
